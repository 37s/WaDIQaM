# (Wa)DIQaM-FR/NR
PyTorch 1.1 (with Python 3.6) implementation of the following paper:

Bosse S, Maniry D, MÃ¼ller K R, et al. [Deep neural networks for no-reference and full-reference image quality assessment](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8063957). IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 2018, 27(1): 206-219.

You can refer to the [chainer](https://chainer.org/) codes (only the test part) from the original authors: [dmaniry/deepIQA](https://github.com/dmaniry/deepIQA)

## Note
- The hyper-parameter settings are not the same as the paper described. Readers can refer to the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8063957) for the exact settings of the original paper.
- Only the WaDIQaM-FR with random crops has been tested.
